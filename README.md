# sudoku_solver
C++ &amp; SFML based sudoku solving program

Project goals:

1) Explore and use a graphics library (SFML) to create a simple GUI:
  a) Sudoku grid.
  b) Possibility to click a cell and change the number inside (remove, add).
  c) "Solve" button to start the solving process.
  
2) Functionality:
  a) Given a set of numbers:
    I) Solve the grid.
    II) Return False if the grid is not solvable.

3) Use the C++ STL where possible to learn about it and practice it.
